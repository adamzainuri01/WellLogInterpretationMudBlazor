# Well Log Interperetation Web App

## General Information
A web-based application for comprehensive well log analysis, built with MudBlazor for an intuitive and responsive interface. The app automates key petrophysical calculations and visualizations, empowering reservoir engineers and geoscientists to make data-driven decisions. With features like clay volume and porosity calculations, water saturation estimation, and net pay determination, the app streamlines the interpretation process â€” transforming raw well log data into actionable reservoir insights. This app uses backend calculation using FastAPI.

Key Features:
- Combo Plot Generation: Visualize multiple log curves in a single plot.
- Clay Volume Calculation: Estimate shale content from gamma-ray logs.
- Porosity Calculation: Compute effective and total porosity.
- Pickett Plot: Analyze resistivity and porosity for fluid identification.
- Water Saturation Calculation: Determine fluid saturation using various models.
- Cut-Off Plot: Apply cut-offs to refine reservoir intervals.
- Net Pay Calculation: Deliver a final interpretation with net pay estimation.
